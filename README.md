# MEng_mod_Langevin
# SoftActiveCells, 23/24 MEng Project Modelling the dynamics of cell populations
## Background
This is the GitHub repository for the 23/24 MEng Project Modelling the dynamics of cell populations, based on the origin repository developed by Fikret Basar. 

## Usage
The main contribution of this project is the addition of noise and geometrical heterogeneity in the previous SAC model. 
The code for the Noise models can be found in the script_x/Langevin folder.
The code generates an array of stochastically distributed stress-free areas for the SAC model.
The model is fully characterized and defined by the input parameters.
The code is adapted from https://hockygroup.hosting.nyu.edu/exercise/langevin-dynamics.html, which is fully in Python. The adaptation is in Julia.
